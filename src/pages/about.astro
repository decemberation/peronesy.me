    Hey there! I’m Pero, a cybersecurity enthusiast, a Fearnot, and as you may
    take the hint from the above background image, I'm an anime enjoyer. My
    passion lies in protecting digital assets, doing CTFs, and helping others
    navigate the ever-evolving online world safely.
  </p>

  <p>
    I always explore new ways to enhance cybersecurity. Right now, I’m pursuing
    my Master's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at WGU, and
    actively seeking job opportunities in the field. I'm also studying for the
    CCNA and CISSP certifications to further my knowledge and skills.

    Beyond security, I spare my time by hitting the gym and playing Counter
    Strike. If this sounds like you, we can maybe rush B together sometime! 🤝
  </p>

  <p>
    This blog is my space to share thoughts, experiences, and lessons learned
    along the way. Doesn't matter who you are, I hope you find something
    valuable here!
  </p>

  <p>Let’s connect and learn together. 🚀</p>
