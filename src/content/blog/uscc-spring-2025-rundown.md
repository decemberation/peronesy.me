So I just attempted the US Cyber Challenge Spring 2025 Quiz. This was such a great opportunity for me to enrich my knowledge in packet analysis and identifying different types of attacks by observing patterns and outputs generated by packet sniffers. Here's a summary of what I learned:

---

## 1. Analyzing Packet Anomalies

- **Multicast MAC Addresses in TCP**:
  - MAC addresses starting with `ff` are multicast addresses, which are used for one-to-many communication.
  - TCP is a unicast protocol, meaning it is designed for one-to-one communication. Hence, using a multicast MAC address (e.g., `ff:0c:29:28:aa:ba`) is anomalous.
  - OUI Lookup Tool: https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html
- **Credit Card Data in Packets**:
  - Sensitive data like credit card information (e.g., `4916792779871`, `CVV: 682`) artificially appended to packets can indicate data exfiltration.

---

## 2. Beaconing Behavior

- **Beaconing** refers to regular outbound communication from a host to a remote system, common in Command & Control (C2) activity.
- Indicators include:
  - Traffic occurring at predictable time intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds).
  - Small data payloads with repetitive connections to the same IP or domain.
  - Usage of common protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to "blend in" with normal traffic.

---

## 3. Amplification Attacks Using NTP

- In **traffic amplification DDoS attacks**, attackers abuse misconfigured services (like NTP).
- Misconfigured servers act as **amplifiers**, unknowingly sending large responses to spoofed victim IPs.
- This drastically increases the volume of traffic hitting the target.

## 4. Data Encoding Recognition

- Recognizing encoding formats is essential:
  - For example, `%48%65%6c%6c%6f` is **URL encoding**.
  - Once decoded, it translates to plain text like `"Hello"`.
- Tools like CyberChef is really helpful to detect data encoding: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/

## 5. Anomalies in TCP Packets

- TCP SYN packets are typically empty (0 bytes payload).
- A SYN packet carrying data (e.g., **5 bytes payload**) could indicate abnormal activity or reconnaissance techniques.

---

## 6. Identifying Open Ports with tcpdump

- Open TCP ports respond with `SYN-ACK ([S.])` packets during the handshake.
- In contrast, closed ports often reply with `RST ([R])`.
- By monitoring traffic:
  - You can spot which ports are actively listening.
  - Confirmed open ports might include common services like **SSH (22)** or **HTTPS (443)**.

## 7. Analyzing TTL Values for router hops

- The TTL value starts at a default value (usually 64, 128, or 255) and decreases by 1 for each router hop.
- For example:
  - If the TTL is 60, the packet has traversed 4 hops (assuming an initial TTL of 64).
  - If the TTL is 124, the packet has traversed 4 hops (assuming an initial TTL of 128).

**Tools commonly used in the challenge:**

- `tcpdump`
- `tshark`
- `Wireshark`
